# Daniel B Lopes da Silva
Hi, my name is Daniel and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Industrial Engineering](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ie/index.html) at Clemson University. I have always been involved with research, teaching, service and outreach. I am passionate about Engineering Education and my long-term career goal is to become a transformative researcher and an effective and inspiring professor.

* Our paper (with Dr. Kelly Sullivan, UARK) **An Optimization-Based Monte Carlo Method for Estimating the Two-Terminal Survival Signature of Networks with Two Component Classes** is published at [NRL](http://doi.org/10.1002/nav.22218).
* I am teaching **IE3800 - Deterministic Operations Research** this Fall semester and I am extremely excited about it!
* I completed the [Traiblazers in Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/Trailblazers) program and I am now an offical [fellow](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/Trailblazers/Fellows/2024/Lopes) of the class of 2024.
* I successfully completed the IISE Future Faculty Fellow (3F) program, with the closing ceremonies being held the IISE Annual Conference & Expo in Montreal, Canada. This was a superb program, beyond all my expectations.  



## Research:

My main research interests include Operations Research (OR) (with a special focus in OR for Social Good) and the theory and applications of network optimization (interdiction, reliability, and resiliency). I am currently working in two really exciting projects: 

1. **Modeling efficient disruption of human trafficking networks** (with Dr. [Thomas Sharkey](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ie/people/faculty/sharkey.html) and Dr. [Yongjia Song](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ie/people/faculty/yongjis.html)):

This is an incredible transdisciplinary project consisting of researchers (at all levels) from Clemson University (advisors Dr. Thomas Sharkey and Dr. Yongjia Song), Northeastern University (advisor Dr. [Kayse Lee Maass](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/maass-kayse/)),
University of Minnesota (advisor Dr. [Laura Martin](https://www.hhh.umn.edu/directory/lauren-martin)), The Research Triangle Institute (Dr. [Kelle Barrick](https://www.rti.org/expert/kelle-barrick)), as well as a survivor-centered advisory group. 

**Papers:**
* **Lopes da Silva, D.B.**, Sharkey, T., Song, Y., _A Bi-level Network Interdiction Problem to Minimize the Number of Active Special Arcs in the Maximum Flow_ (Second round review at the INFORMS Journal on Computing, 2023);
* **Lopes da Silva, D.B.**, Sharkey, T., Song, Y., Mass, K.L., Ayler, T., Forliti, T., Friedman, J., Mariotti, M., Nelson, C., Barrick, K., Martin, L., Voller, V. _Bi-Objective Bi-level Network Interdiction Models for Effective Disruption in Human Trafficking Networks_ (Working paper, 2024).
* **Lopes da Silva, D.B.**, Sharkey, T., Song, Y., _A Robust Bi-level Network Interdiction Problem with Application in Human Trafficking Disruption_ (Working paper, 2024).

2. **Methods for estmating the survival signature of heterogeneous networks** (with Dr. [Kelly Sullivan](https://industrial-engineering.uark.edu/directory/index/uid/ksulliv/name/Kelly-Sullivan/)).

I started to work in this project during my M.S. degree with Dr. Kelly Sullivan at the University of Arkansas, and the original idea was for me to work on developing optimal deployment policies for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (based on reliability, costs, etc.). Half way through, after reading a nice paper that introduced a *Dijkstra-like* bi-objective algorithm, we shifted focus and started to develop an optimization-based methodology to estimate the survival signature of a network with two component classes. The methodology turned out to be very efficient, flexible, and robust, opening the door for a lot of interesting lines for future investigation.

**Papers:**
* **Lopes da Silva, D.B., Sullivan, K.**, _An Optimization-Based Monte Carlo method for Estimating the Two-Terminal Survival Signature of Networks with Two Component Classes_ (Naval Research Logistics);
* Chakrabarty, N., Sullivan, K., **Lopes da Silva, D.B.**, _Time-Based Redeployment of Multiclass Nodes for Reliable Wireless Sensor Network Coverage_ (Forthcoming in Computers \& Industrial Engineering);

### Previous Research Activity:
- During my undegraduate capstone project, I investigated supply chain performance metrics and proposed a conceptual framework for performance evaluation. We published our results (in Portguese) this [paper](https://periodicos.uninove.br/exacta/article/view/8612);

### Conference Papers (from my undergraduate years!)

## Teaching

I am teaching **IE3800 - Deterministic Operations Research** in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Clemson University and I am extremely excited about it. The course is one of the most interesting and engaging and I love to plan the lectures, work on the examples and codes, give lectures and student hours.

I love to teach and I learn a lot by teaching! My first official experience with teaching was when I was in high school. I attended a great technical institute in Brazil, the [Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology (Federal Institute for short)](https://www2.ifal.edu.br/campus/palmeira), where I had the chance to be a teaching assistant for the physics class.

During my bachelor's degree, I had the chance to be an official (and extra-official) TA for a bunch of courses such as introduction to programming, analytical geometry, calculus, and operations research. During my first M.S. degree in Industrial Engineering (Optimization) at the [Federal University of Pernambuco, Brazil](https://www.ufpe.br/en/dep), I was a partial TA for the graph theory class.

During my Ph.D. program in Clemson, I was a TA for:
* IE 8590 Capstone Design Project (Instructor: Dr. [Ozgur Kabadurmus](https://www.uwec.edu/profiles/kabaduro/))
* IE 3860 Production Planning and Control (Instructor: Dr. Thomas Sharkey)
* IE 4460/6460 Modeling and Analysis of Manufacturing Systems (Instructor: Dr. [Bill Ferrell](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ie/people/faculty/ferrell.html))


## Service, Communities, Outreach

#### INFORMS
I am the current president of the INFORMS Student Chapter at Clemson University (2023-2024), after having served as its vice-president in the 2022-2023 academic term (we received the Magna Cum Laude Award 2023). Check our social pages to see what we have been up to lately: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/informs-clemson-student-chapter-057b62286/), [X(Twitter)](https://twitter.com/ClemsonInforms), [website](https://cecas.clemson.edu/informs/). I have also served as the secretary of the INFORMS Student Chapter at the University of Arkansas during my M.S. program there (we received the Cum Laude Award 2022).

### PET Engenharias (Tutorial Education Program in Engineering)
During my undergraduate years at the [Federal Unviersity of Alagoas](https://ufal.br/) (Brazil), I was a member (and eventually the president) of the PET Engenharias [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/petengenharias), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pet.engenharias/), [Official Page](https://ufal.br/estudante/graduacao/programas/educacao-tutorial-pet/pet-engenharia) (Tutorial Education Program in Engineering), which consisted of a group of students guided by a faculty advisor and tasked with developing research, teaching, and outreach activities.

During my four-year term at **PET Engenharias**, we did a lot of interesting (and fun) activities and events, including a mentoring program for first-year engineering students, itinerant STEM Fairs at local schools, prep course for a disadvantaged community, pre-calculus course for first-year students, seminars, and much more. See the old, bad-quality, awesome pictures below for a flavor of how awesome this program is!
